#  ESP32 Dice Game with LED Matrix

This is an interactive dice game built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, an **8x32 LED matrix display**, and a **joystick push button**. The game simulates rolling two dice with animated transitions and displays the result on the matrix.

---

##  Features

-  Rolls two dice and displays their faces
-  Single-button input to roll the dice
-  Uses `MD_MAX72XX` and `MD_Parola` libraries for matrix animation
-  Smooth dice rolling animation
-  Idle message scrolls when no input is detected
